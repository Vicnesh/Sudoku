# Sudoku Game

Sudoku Game has a 9x9 grid where each cell can only contain a value within the range of 1-9. For each cell there are 3 rules/constraints further explained below. This is attempt to practice programming skills mainly algorithm design, problem solving and basic GUI design for the grid cells.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each cell in the grid, there are constraints to be followed:

1) Value can only be in the range of 1-9
2) Value of each cell cannot exist in any cell of the row
3) Value of each cell cannot exist in any cell of the column
4) Value of each cell cannot exist in any 3x3 grid in which the cell resides in

Done:
- GUI puzzle 9x9 grid constructing
- Using a backtracking algorithm to generate a puzzle
- Code clean up and comments


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToDo:
1) Use other possible solution to generate a solved puzzle
2) Implement a way to determine if the puzzle cannot be solved and solution to this problem
